ðŸŽ® **Project Showcase: The Stick Man Game** ðŸŽ®

I'm excited to share my latest project: **The Stick Man Game**! This fun and interactive game is built using JavaScript (90.4%), CSS (5.9%), and HTML (3.7%).

**Project Highlights:**
- **JavaScript-Driven Gameplay:** The core mechanics and gameplay are powered by JavaScript, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.
- **Stylish and Minimalist Design:** Uses CSS to enhance the visual appeal with a simple yet effective design.
- **Structured HTML:** Employs HTML for a solid and well-structured foundation, ensuring semantic and accessible design.

The Stick Man Game showcases my ability to develop dynamic and interactive web applications with a focus on engaging gameplay and user experience.
